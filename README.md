# FRONTEND  - "News app with Firebase integration"

Authorized users can access and read news articles even when they're offline thanks to this Next.js app, which is made to fetch news articles from an API. It is possible for users to create a personal list of their favorite news articles. The application uses Firebase Firestore for data storage and Google authentication. Redux is used for state management, which guarantees effective and seamless handling of user interactions and data updates.
